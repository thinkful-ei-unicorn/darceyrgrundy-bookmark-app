Thank you for taking the time to look over and grade my assignment! Here are my user stories for this bookmarks app.

My app will display a list of premade bookmarks (depending on the day) from Thinkful's bookmarks API. It will allow users to hit add new bookmark and submit their own. All bookmarks need a title and a link, obviously. They can also have descriptions and star ratings that are optional. The front page display bookmarks, an option to add new ones, and a way to sort bookmarks by rating. The bookmarks on the front page will only display the title and star rating. Clicking on one of the displayed bookmarks will allow the user to see more details like descriptions and allows you to visit the link. On the add bookmark page, it will prompt the user for each required portion and will send an error when they leave out any of them. If the user decides they don't want to submit a bookmark, they can hit cancel and head back. When you successfully add a new bookmark, it will prompt the original page with the added bookmark shown.
